# GUI-Advanced-Programming-Course-2024 -> Final Project
A TUI-based app designed as an interface for interacting with a restaurant, supporting both customer and admin users.
    
    - Customer Features:
        - Place orders
        - View previous orders

    - Admin Features:
        - Edit food menu
        - Manage tables
        - Extract filtered orders by date, order type, and food menu items

I received full marks for this project from the course [TA](https://github.com/capamir).
